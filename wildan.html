        <h2>Death of Hu Tao grandfather</h2>
        <img src="hutao grandpa.jpg">
        <p id="death">
            This tale should begin with the funeral of Hu Tao's grandfather. Ten days
            before the funeral itself. Old Hu had passed away following about of illness. 
            For it's 75th Director. Wangsheng Funeral Parlor held a grand funeral, in accordance
            with the last wishes of the old man himself to be conducted by Hu Tao.
        </p>
        <h2>Become director</h2>
        <p id="director">
            Only thirteen at the time. Hu Tao, who would later go on to become the Director in turn,
            made all the arrangements herself to the highest standard, greatly impressing the undertakers. </p>
        
        <h2>Journey for her grandfather</h2>
        <p id="journey">
            After the funeral, the thirteen-year-old Hu Tao grabbed her traveler's bag and crept out alone
            in the dead of night. In her bag were only a few rations, some water, and a means to create some light. She 
            was headed to a mysterious and seldom-seen frontier.
            Heading straight from Wuwang Hill, one may arrive at the "border." It is the line that separates life and death, 
            the secrets of which have been managed by Wangsheng Funeral Parlor for generations. According to the legend, it is a place
            where the souls of past relatives and the spirits of those with unfulfilled aspirations linger. For Hu Tao, this journey
            was a chance to see her grandfather once more before he departed forever.
        </p>
        <h2>Exhaustion</h2>
        <p id="exhaustion">
            For two days she jorneyed uncreasingly before finally arriving at her destination, yet was unable to locate her grandfather 
            upon arrival. Between the innumerable spirits she walked, but not one of them resembled the old man. She stayed there the whole day
            before falling asleep in exhaustion, awakening to a night sky and heavy dew. Around her were gathered a few lone spirits, clapping and laughing:
            "Silly girl, why would Old Hu be here of all places? WHat were you thinking, looking for your relatives here?"
        </p>
        <h2>Little old woman</h2>
        <p id="old woman">
            Not one to be swayed so easily, Hu Tao continued to wait, day after day. Her rations gradually disappeared and her water supplies drained away, but her
            grandfather did not appear. In the end, it was a little old woman who came to her. She laid eyes on the exhausted Hu Tao and smiled as she spoke:"
            Look at your stubbornness, you're exactly like Old Hu. It's a shame, but none of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor Directors would ever linger here. You come from a family of plain
            speakers, so let me return the favor... Go back. Go back to where you ame from."
        </p>
        <h2>Regretful</h2>
        <p id="regretful">
            The old woman bid farewell to Hu Tao, before passing over the border and into the distance. Hu Tao watched as the figure of ther mysterious woman grew smaller and disappeared, as a sense
            of doubt tinged with relief manifested itself. At last she came to the conclusion: her grandfather's absence was due to him having passed over the border as soon as he'd arrived, to the place
            where he was bound. He had been open and honest in life, leaving behind no regrets, so was it right for his depature to be framed in regretful terms? With a smile, she set forth on the return journey.
        </p>
        <h2>Hu Tao vision</h2>
        <p id="vision">
            The faraway moon had been castinga thin light on the way over but had now been replaced by the bright light of dawn. As she walked, Hu Tao thought of a saying that her grandfather had often quoted: "live in life,
            die in death. Follow your heart, do what you can." It was noon when Hu Tao arrived home. She climbed over the wall into the rear courtyard, went straight to her room, and unoacked her travel bag. With her food and water long gone,
            and the rest of her belongings unpacked, the bag she had taken for empty instead contained a colorful Vision. Just when had it arrived? As one of the few living that had dared to visit the border, perhaps Hu Tao's actions had moved
            some unknown god. Perhaps this then constituted a heavenly gift... the ultimate recognition of her strengh.
